    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern agricultural techniques, which have mostly focused on rice, wheat, or maize crops, have ensued in the extinction of a large number of agricultural varieties favoring a small number of species (Singh et al., 2020). 
        <br><br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single-crop cultivation ,<a href="">art and science</a> that relies largely on external inputs has pushed agrobiodiversity and the resulting ecological complexity to their breaking point, resulting in global pollution and catastrophic ecosystem degradation. Due to a lack of species diversity, lower adaptation strategies, and environmental resilience, monocropping systems are more prone to pest invasion, yield loss, and climatic uncertainty (Gan et al., 2014). Crop diversification tactics that include cereals, millets, legumes, pulses, vegetables, nuts, fruits, rhizomes, curative plants, and other crops are crucial for environmentally sustainable husbandry (Singh et al., 2020).

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This case study smart agricultural techniques of paddy rice in Japan were introduced. Although these are in the process of evolution, it is expected that the basic concept of ‘aggregating agricultural machines and observation sensors to generate big data’ will not change in future. IoT in Japanese agriculture implies the management strategy to increase productivity and economic returns with reduced environmental concerns, looking at the variability within/between the fields. Variability description, variable-rate technology and decision support system are the key technology for precision farming.,<a href="">how to inspire Indians youth to take into farming</a>

            <h1 id="right">ORGANIC FORMING</h1>
            <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic farming can be defined as an agricultural process that uses biological fertilisers and pest control acquired from animal or plant waste. Organic farming was actually initiated as an answer to the environmental sufferings caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers. In other words, organic farming is a new system of farming or agriculture that repairs, maintains, and improves the ecological balance.
                <br><br>
                Advantages of Organic Farming
Economical: In organic farming, no expensive fertilisers, pesticides, or HYV seeds are required for the plantation of crops. Therefore, there is no extra expense.

Good return on Investment: With the usage of cheaper and local inputs, a farmer can make a good return on investment.

High demand: There is a huge demand for organic products in India and across the globe, which generates more income through export.

Nutritional: As compared to chemical and fertiliser-utilised products, organic products are more nutritional, tasty, and good for 

Environment-friendly: The farming of organic products is free of chemicals and fertilisers, so it does not harm the environment.

            <h1 id="right"> CONVENTIONAL FORMING</h1>
            <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conventional farming practices, together with the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, excessive water use and fossil fuels, and frequent planting of single crops are short-term measures. Generally food is grown as economically as possible, allowing farmers to make a living and the crop to continue to be affordable for everyone. Nevertheless, in the long term, conventional farming practices are not sustainable. The fertilized soil becomes overloaded with chemical toxins, and low in nutrients. Useable land becomes rare, and the use of water and energy become high, with financial costs and it is not environmentally friendly (Cowling, 2013).
<br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have long-term success nourishing an over-growing population, farmers will have to change their crop-growing patterns. Crop rotation, along with natural fertilization, allows farmers to often harvest generous crops from healthy soil. It does not permit the release of more chemicals into the environment, and reduces the use of nonrenewable capitals. Furthermore, it transports the user with nutrient ridiculous food, instead of low-quality crops. The capability of the farming industry to supply wheat as staple food in eco-friendly manner in the future will have a huge effect on the prosperity of the world population (Cowling, 2013).</p>

                    <h1 id="right"> GENERIC FORMING</h1>
                    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S. and many nations around the globe, virtually all chickens, turkeys, and eggs come from genetically modified birds—including those labeled natural, organic, and free-range or bearing animal welfare certifications. The genetic abuse of these birds has led to fast growth at the expense of the animals’ health. Hybrid birds are bred to maximize weight gain in minimal time, leading to severe welfare problems from birth to death.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronic hunger is an often-overlooked genetic welfare issue, but it is endemic in breeder lines essential for producing today’s fast-growing broiler chickens. These birds are physiologically incapable of ever feeling satisfied after eating feed; they are condemned to live in the agitated state of animals desperately trying to fill their stomachs. By genetically preventing birds from experiencing satiety, producers ensure that the birds will keep eating, thereby gaining weight more quickly. The cost in terms of welfare is difficult to calculate, amounting to a new form of genetic abuse.

                        <h1 id="right"> COMMUNITY FORMING</h1>
                        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community farming offers many benefits to farmers who want to practice sustainable agriculture and to communities who want fresh, healthy, locally-produced food. By supporting community farms, local communities can invest directly in their food system, secure farmland for the future, help create sources of healthy, locally-produced food, and enjoy social, economic, environmental, and agricultural benefits.
                            <br><br>
                            People who care about protecting farmland and healthy, local food come together to build and support community farms in their neighbourhoods. Some assist the community groups that are needed to govern the farm, some want to farm and value the collaborative approach of the community farm model, and others simply wish to enjoy fresh, healthy food, or visit a farm.</P>
